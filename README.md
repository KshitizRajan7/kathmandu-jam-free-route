# kathmandu-jam-free-route

A real-time, mobile-responsive route finder for Kathmandu Valley that helps users navigate jam-free roads using live traffic data and interactive maps.

## Project Structure

- `/frontend` — Frontend application built with Next.js.  
  Currently, this is the only part of the project.  
  **Recent updates:**

  - Added a trafficPolice cartoon that appears to notify users about heavy traffic in Kathmandu Valley. The cartoon is visible only when there are no markers on the map or when the map is reset. In the future, this will act as a chatbot/AI guide for users.

- `/backend` — _(Coming soon)_ Backend API and server to provide live traffic data and route calculations.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

To run the frontend locally:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
