# kathmandu-jam-free-route

A real-time, mobile-responsive route finder for Kathmandu Valley that helps users navigate jam-free roads using live traffic data and interactive maps.

  Currently, this is the only part of the project.  
  **Recent updates:**

  - Allowed user location to be marked on the map by enabling browser location through a built-in component.

- `/backend` — _(Coming soon)_ Backend API and server to provide live traffic data and route calculations.
